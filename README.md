# Test-Bot-BDFD 🤖

## About 📝  
**Test-Bot-BDFD** is a Discord bot made in **BDFD (bdscript)** — because apparently I was bored enough to code instead of sleeping.  
It does stuff. You can use it if you want. 😎  

## Commands ⚡  
- **Prefix:** `t/` (yes, I still remember old-school commands exist)  
- **Slash Commands:** ✅ Supported (because Discord made me do it)  
- **Help Command:** `t/help` or `/help` — for when you have zero clue what you’re doing 🤷  

## Availability ⏰  
Not guaranteed to be online 24/7.  
Not because BDFD is bad (though it kinda is 😬), but because **my lazy self refuses to watch ads** to keep it hosted.  

## Contact 📬  
Found a bug? Have a suggestion? Want to yell at me for my laziness?  
Hit up **Lezi** on Discord:

BDFD sucks. Seriously. If you want to do real bot stuff, check out **[ForgeScript](https://docs.botforge.org)**.
